    # Intuition:
    # Group numbers from 1 to n based on the sum of their digits.
    # For example, 13 â†’ sum = 1 + 3 = 4, so 13 belongs to group "4".
    # Use a hashmap to count how many numbers fall into each digit-sum group.
    # Then, find the size of the largest group(s), and count how many groups have that size.
